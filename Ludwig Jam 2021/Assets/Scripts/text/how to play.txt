How to play:

First things first. You can play this game with keyboard or with a controller.
Press the "ARROW" keys or move the left stick to... move of course!

Jumping is an essential part of this game so don't hesitate smashing the "SPACE" button or
the "A" or "B" button on your controller. You also have one extra jump in the air AKA the double jump.

Computers don't save their data in order, they jump from one file to another... at least this one does.
Therefore you have to press the "X" key or the "X" or "Y" button on the controller to switch between
different files. Remember that.

Sometimes the ceiling will be to low for you to get to the other side. Those kind of situations literally scream for
the "DOWN ARROW" or the "TRIGGER" ("LEFT" or "RIGHT") button, because you'll start to crouch - reduces the size and the speed.

When you hit the wall mid air, you'll begin to slide. While sliding, you'll be able to jump to places unreachable with normal jumps.
ATTENTION: Wall sliding doesn't give you your double jump back, so save it for some sticky situations.
Also, if you don't like to slide anymore, pressing the "DOWN ARROW" or "TRIGGER" button will do the work.
