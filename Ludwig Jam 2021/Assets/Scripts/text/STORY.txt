We all know the feeling, when you work on your computer but forget to save regularly...

You are having a presentation called "City Live VS. Country Live" tomorrow and yeah, you wasn't thinking about it... till five hours ago at least.
You manage to make the majority of your presentation on your mom's laptop, but you weren't saving. And it comes even worse!

Mom's laptop has only 30 % percent battery left and you can't find the charger. In panic of not losing all of your work, you choose to do
the only one logical option - you klick on save and now you are safe, right???

NO! Two clicks for you is for the computer still a lot of work, but luckily there is a cute little SaveNight, who is doing it's best to
safely deliver your work to the main disc.

Will he be successful?
